# RUIAN
Simple RUIAN API .NET library. This project is by no means a complete implementation. It originated as a part of a larger project I decided to open source.

The original ArcGIS RUIAN REST API is avalable [here](https://ags.cuzk.cz/arcgis/rest/services/RUIAN).

This site serves only as documentationâ€”more information about the project is available on [Github](https://github.com/KrystofS/RUIAN).
